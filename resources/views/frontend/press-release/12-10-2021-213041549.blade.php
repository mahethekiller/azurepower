                            <li>Megawatts ("MW") Operating* were 2,210 MWs, as of September 30, 2021, an increase of 31%
                                over September 30, 2020. Operating, Contracted &amp; Awarded MWs* were 6,955 MWs, as of
                                September 30, 2021. Contracted &amp; Awarded megawatts included 4,000 MWs for which we
                                had received Letters of Award ("LOA") but the Power Purchase Agreements ("PPAs") had not
                                been signed as of September 30, 2021. Subsequent to the quarter end, we have signed PPAs
                                for 600 MWs with SECI in relation to the 4,000 MW project, refer the detailed
                                explanation in the key operating Metrices section below. </li>
                            <li>Operating revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2021 were INR 4,386 million (
                                <money>US$ 59.1 million</money>), an increase of 25% over the quarter ended September
                                30, 2020. </li>
                            <li>Net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2021 was INR 300 million (<money>US$ 4.0
                                    million</money>) against the net loss of INR 368 million for the quarter ended
                                September 30, 2020. The decline in Net loss was primarily due to additional revenue from
                                sale of carbon credits and reversal of stock appreciation rights (SARs) expense, offset
                                by increase in legal and professional expense and tax expense, refer the detailed
                                explanation in the Net loss/ (profit) section below. </li>
                            <li>Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended September 30, 2021 was INR 3,685 million (<money>
                                    US$ 49.8 million</money>), an increase of 59% over the quarter ended September 30,
                                2020. The increase was primarily due to additional revenue from new projects,&nbsp; sale
                                of carbon credits and reversal of stock appreciation rights (SARs) expense, partially
                                offset by increase in legal and professional expense, during the quarter ended September
                                30, 2021. </li>
                            <li>Non-GAAP Cash Flow to Equity ("CFe") from operating assets for the quarter ended
                                September 30, 2021 was INR 1,406 million (<money>US$ 18.9 million</money>), an increase
                                of 32% over the quarter ended September 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to
                                additional revenue from sale of carbon credits and lower interest cost relating to
                                existing operational projects due to refinancing.</li>

                            portfolio, for which we entered into an agreement to sell in April 2021. We excluded 153 MWs
                            from our Operating, Contracted &amp; Awarded portfolio as of September 30, 2021, and the
                            prior comparative period. We excluded 153 MWs from our Operating portfolio as of September
                            30, 2021, and 144 MWs from prior comparable period. <i>The exclusion from prior period is
                                for the purpose of comparison with current period, however we continue to consolidate
                                these assets.</i></p>
                        <p><b><i>Key Operating Metrics</i></b></p>
                        <p>Electricity generation during the quarter and six-months ended September 30, 2021 was 1,001
                            million kWh and 2,113 million kWH, respectively, an increase of 231 million kWh or 30%, over
                            the quarter ended September 30, 2020, and an increase of 460 million kWH or 28%, over the
                            six months ended September 30, 2020. The increase in electricity generation was principally
                            a result of an additional 529 MWs of AC (728 MWs DC) operating capacity, including our
                            Rooftop portfolio commissioned since September 30, 2020. </p>
                        <p>Our Plant Load Factor ("PLF") for the quarter and six month ended September 30, 2021, was
                            20.2% and 21.9%, compared to 18.8% and 20.8%, respectively, for the same comparable periods
                            in 2020, which increased principally due to the addition of AC and DC capacity and improved
                            performance by our plants, including Rooftop portfolio. Our Plant Load Factor
                            ("PLF"),&nbsp;excluding rooftop portfolio, for the quarter and six month ended September 30,
                            2021, was 21.1% and 22.9%
                            respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        </p>
                        <p>We commissioned 158 MWs AC (188&nbsp;MWs DC) during the three months ended September 30, 2021
                            and 220&nbsp;MWs AC (252&nbsp;MWs DC) during the six months ended September 30, 2021 against
                            25 MWs AC (25 MWs DC) during the comparative three months and 26 MWs AC (28 MWs DC) during
                            the six months ended September 30,
                            2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>Project cost per megawatt operating (megawatt capacity per the PPA or AC) consists of costs
                            incurred for one megawatt of newly commissioned solar power plant capacity during the
                            reporting period. The project cost per megawatt (DC) operating for the six months ended
                            September 30, 2021 remains same as for comparative period i.e. INR 34.7 million (<money>US$
                                0.47 million</money>). The project cost per megawatt (AC) operating for the six months
                            ended September 30, 2021 was INR 39.6 million (<money>US$ 0.53 million</money>), compared to
                            INR 40.4 million, for the six months ended September 30, 2020. Excluding the impact of
                            safeguard duties, the DC and the AC costs per megawatt for the six months ended September
                            30, 2021 would have been lower by approximately INR 2.9 million (<money>US$ 0.04 million
                            </money>) and INR 3.3 million (<money>US$ 0.04 million</money>), respectively, and for the
                            six months ended September 30, 2020, the DC and the AC costs per megawatt would have been
                            lower by approximately INR 1.3 million and INR 1.3 million, respectively.</p>
                        <p>As of September 30, 2021, our Operating, Contracted &amp; Awarded megawatts were 6,955 MWs.
                            There was no change compared to prior comparable period, other than to reflect the disposal
                            of the Rooftop Portfolio. Contracted &amp; Awarded megawatts included 4,000 MWs for which we
                            had received LOAs but the PPAs had not been signed as of September 30, 2021. Subsequent to
                            the quarter, the Company has also received letter of awards (LOA), for its first 120 MWs
                            wind project and first 150 MWs solar – wind hybrid project, from Solar Energy Corporation of
                            <location value="LC/in" idsrc="xmltag.org">India</location> (SECI)</p>
                        <p>Subsequent to the quarter end, we have signed PPAs for 600 MWs with SECI at a fixed tariff of
                            INR 2.54 per kWh for supply power for 25 years, as a part of 4,000 MW manufacturing linked
                            projects.</p>
                        <p><b><i>Megawatts Operating and Megawatts Contracted &amp; Awarded</i></b></p>
                        <p>We measure the rated capacity of our plants in megawatts. Rated capacity is the expected
                            maximum output that a solar power plant can produce without exceeding its design limits. We
                            believe that tracking the growth in aggregate megawatt rated capacity is a measure of the
                            growth rate of our business.</p>
                        <p>"Megawatts Operating" represents the aggregate cumulative megawatt rated capacity of solar
                            power plants that are commissioned and operational as of the reporting date.</p>
                        <p><i>"</i>Megawatts Contracted &amp; Awarded<i>"</i> represents the aggregate megawatt rated
                            capacity of solar power plants pursuant to customer PPAs signed, allotted or won in an
                            auction but not commissioned and operational as of the reporting date. </p>
                        <p><b><i>Nominal Contracted Payments for Projects with PPAs</i></b></p>
                        <p>Our PPAs create long-term recurring customer payments. Nominal contracted payments equal the
                            sum of the estimated payments that the customer is likely to make, subject to discounts or
                            rebates, over the remaining term of the PPAs. When calculating nominal contracted payments,
                            we include those PPAs for projects that are Operating, Contracted &amp; Awarded, unless
                            specified.</p>
                        <p>The following table sets forth, with respect to our PPAs as referred above, the aggregate
                            nominal contracted payments and total estimated energy output as of the reporting dates.
                            These nominal contracted payments have not been discounted to arrive at the present value.

                        <p>* Nominal contracted payments include projects for 600 MWs which amounts to INR 98,937
                            million (<money>US$1.3 billion</money>), for which PPAs are signed subsequent to quarter end
                            in relation to 4,000 MWs project with SECI.</p>
                        <p>The increase in Nominal Contracted Payments and total estimated energy output as of September
                            30, 2021, as compared to September 30, 2020, is due to inclusion of 600 MWs for which PPAs
                            are signed subsequent to quarter end, partially offset by exclusion of our rooftop
                            portfolio, which we have agreed to sell during the current period and the impact of current
                            period revenue realised.</p>
                        <p>Our nominal contracted payments are not impacted for the delays in construction due to
                            COVID-19, as revenues from our PPAs start on the date of commissioning of the project.</p>
                        <p><b><i>Portfolio Revenue Run-Rate for Projects with PPAs</i></b></p>
                        <p>Portfolio revenue run-rate for projects with PPAs equals annualized payments from customers
                            extrapolated based on the Operating, Contracted &amp; Awarded capacity as of the reporting
                            dates. In estimating the portfolio revenue run-rate, we multiply the PPA contract per
                            kilowatt hour by the estimated annual energy output for all Operating, Contracted &amp;
                            Awarded solar projects as of the reporting date. The estimated annual energy output of our
                            solar projects is calculated using power generation simulation software and validated by
                            independent engineering firms. The main assumption used in the calculation is the project
                            location, which enables the software to derive the estimated annual energy output from
                            certain meteorological data, including the temperature and solar insolation based on the
                            project location.</p>
                        <p>The following table sets forth, with respect to our PPAs as referred above, the aggregate
                            portfolio revenue run-rate and estimated annual energy output as of the reporting dates. The
                            portfolio revenue run-rate has not been discounted to arrive at the present value.</p>

                            between 2,750 – 2,955, excluding the rooftop portfolio, for which we have entered into an
                            agreement to sell during the current period. We continue to expect revenues of between INR

                            under-construction projects does not impact our revenues we expect during the 25-year PPA
                            because revenues begin from the actual date of commissioning.</p>

                        <p><b>Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures</b></p>
                        <p><b><i>Adjusted EBITDA</i></b></p>
                        <p>Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental
                            measure of its performance. This measurement is not recognized in accordance with <location
                                value="LC/us" idsrc="xmltag.org">U.S.</location> GAAP and should not be viewed as an
                            alternative to <location value="LC/us" idsrc="xmltag.org">U.S.</location> GAAP measures
                            of performance. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference
                            that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.</p>
                        <p>We define Adjusted EBITDA as loss (income) plus (a) income tax expense/(benefit), (b)
                            interest expense, net, (c) depreciation and amortization (d) loss/ (gain) on foreign
                            currency exchange, net, (e) Other expenses/ (income) and (f) Impairment loss. We believe
                            Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in assessing our ongoing financial performance and
                            provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that
                            management believes are not indicative of our operational profitability and that may obscure
                            underlying business results and trends. However, this measure should not be considered in
                            isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income or other measures of performance
                            determined in accordance with <location value="LC/us" idsrc="xmltag.org">U.S.</location>
                            GAAP. Moreover, Adjusted EBITDA as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other
                            similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods
                            of calculation.</p>
                        <p>Our management believes this measure is useful to compare general operating performance from
                            period to period and to make certain related management decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is also
                            used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies
                            because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among
                            companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be highly dependent on
                            our capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. Therefore, the impact of interest
                            expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. In addition, the tax positions
                            of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits
                            and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate. As a
                            result, effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies.</p>
                        <p>Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in
                            isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under <location
                                value="LC/us" idsrc="xmltag.org">U.S.</location> GAAP. Some of these limitations
                            include:</p>
                        <ul type="disc">
                            <li>it does not reflect cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or
                                contractual commitments or foreign exchange gain/loss; </li>
                            <li>it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital; </li>
                            <li>it does not reflect significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to
                                service interest or principal payments on outstanding debt; </li>
                            <li>it does not reflect payments made or future requirements for income taxes; and </li>
                            <li>although depreciation, amortization and impairment are non-cash charges, the assets
                                being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or paid in the future and
                                Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements or payments.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Investors are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider it
                            appropriate for supplemental analysis. For more information, please see the Reconciliations
                            of Net loss to Adjusted EBITDA in this document.</p>
                        <p><b>Cash Flow to Equity (CFe)</b></p>
                        <p>Cash Flows to Equity is a Non-GAAP financial measure. We present CFe as a supplemental
                            measure of our performance. This measurement is not recognized in accordance with <location
                                value="LC/us" idsrc="xmltag.org">U.S.</location> GAAP and should not be viewed as an
                            alternative to <location value="LC/us" idsrc="xmltag.org">U.S.</location> GAAP measures
                            of performance. The presentation of CFe should not be construed as an inference that our
                            future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.</p>
                        <p>We believe GAAP metrics, such as net income (loss) and cash from operating activities, do not
                            provide the same level of visibility into the performance and prospects of our operating
                            business as a result of the long-term capital-intensive nature of our businesses, non-cash
                            depreciation and amortization, cash used for debt servicing as well as investments and costs
                            related to the growth of our business. </p>
                        <p>Our business owns high-value, long-lived assets capable of generating substantial Cash Flows
                            to Equity over time. We define CFe as profit/ (loss) before tax (the most comparable GAAP
                            metric), adjusted for net cash provided for/ used in operating activities, other than
                            changes in operating assets and liabilities, income and deferred taxes and amortization of
                            hedging costs; less: cash paid for income taxes, debt amortization, maintenance capital
                            expenditure and prepaid lease payments and employee benefits.</p>
                        <p>We believe that changes in operating assets and liabilities is cyclical for cash flow
                            generation of our assets, due to a high growth environment. Furthermore, to reflect the
                            actual cash outflows for income tax, we deduct income and deferred taxes computed under US
                            GAAP presented in our consolidated financial statements and instead include the actual cash
                            tax outflow during the period, are considered as part of tax expense.</p>
                        <p>We believe that external consumers of our financial statements, including investors and
                            research analysts, use CFe both to assess Company's performance and as an indicator of its
                            success in generating an attractive risk-adjusted total return, assess the value of the
                            business and the platform. This has been a widely used metric by analysts to value our
                            business, and hence we believe this will better help potential investors in analysing the
                            cash generation from our operating assets.</p>
                        <p>We have disclosed CFe for our operational assets on a consolidated basis, which is not our
                            cash from operations on a consolidated basis. We believe CFe supplements GAAP results to
                            provide a more complete understanding of the financial and operating performance of our
                            businesses than would not otherwise be achieved using GAAP results alone. CFe should be used
                            as a supplemental measure and not in lieu of our financial results reported under GAAP. </p>
                        <p>We have also bifurcated the CFe into "Operational Assets" and "Others", as defined below, so
                            that users of our financial statements are able to understand the Cash generation from our
                            operational assets.</p>
                        <p>We define our "Operational Assets", as the projects which had commenced operations on or
                            before September 30, 2021. The operational assets represent the MWs operating as on the
                            date. </p>
                        <p>We define "Others" as (i) the project SPV's which are under construction, or under
                            development, (ii) "corporate" which includes our three <location value="LC/mu"
                                idsrc="xmltag.org">Mauritius</location> entities, (iii)other projects not covered under
                            operational assets, (iv) a company incorporated in <location value="LC/us"
                                idsrc="xmltag.org">the United States</location> and (v) other entities under the group
                            which are newly incorporated. </p>
                        <p>We define "debt amortisation" as the current portion of long-term debt which has been repaid
                            during the period as part of debt repayment obligations, excluding the debt which has been
                            repaid, extinguished or refinanced. It does not include the amortisation of debt financing
                            costs, and interest and hedge payments during the period.</p>
                        <p><i>Other items from the Statement of Cash Flows </i>include most of the items that reconcile
                            "Net (loss) gain" and "Changes in operating assets and liabilities" from the Statement of
                            Cash Flows, other than deferred taxes, non-cash employee benefit and amortization of hedging

                                expenditures</i><br>All our capital expenditures are considered Growth Capital
                            Expenditures. In broad terms, we expense all expenditures in the current period that would
                            primarily maintain our businesses at current levels of operations, capability, profitability
                            or cash flow in operations and maintenance and therefore there are no Maintenance capital
                            expenditures. Growth capital expenditures primarily provide new or enhanced levels of
                            operations, capability, profitability or cash flows. </p>
